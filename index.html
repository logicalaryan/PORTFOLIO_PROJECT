          <h2>Hi, I'm Aryan 👋</h2>
          <p>
            I am a full stack developer skilled in building scalable web
            applications using modern frontend and backend technologies. I have
            hands-on experience with React, Node.js, and databases to design
            complete end-to-end solutions. Along with web development, I also
            build machine learning projects to solve real-world problems using
            data-driven approaches. I enjoy transforming ideas into functional
            products with clean code and strong architecture. I have worked on
            projects like e-commerce clones and prediction systems that improved
            my problem-solving skills. I understand APIs, authentication, and
            deployment on cloud platforms. I am comfortable collaborating in
            teams and following agile practices. My ML experience includes data
            preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. I continuously learn
            new tools to stay updated with industry trends. I aim to contribute
            to impactful projects while growing as a versatile software
            engineer.

          I have strong skills in HTML and CSS to build clean, responsive user
          interfaces. I use React to create dynamic and interactive frontend
          applications. With Node.js, I develop scalable backend APIs and
          server-side logic. I combine frontend and backend to deliver complete
          full stack solutions. I also use Python for scripting and building
          machine learning projects. My skill set helps me turn ideas into real,
          working applications. I am constantly improving my skills to become a
          better software engineer.

          <div class="text">
            I bridge the gap between complex machine learning models and
            user-friendly web applications, creating a rare intersection of data
            science and full-stack development. By maintaining a strong command
            of both React for dynamic frontends and Node.js for scalable
            backends, I take end-to-end ownership over every project I build.
            Unlike a traditional developer, I love integrating data-driven logic
            and Python-based prediction systems to solve real-world problems
            rather than just writing static code. I prioritize clean
            architecture and scalable solutions, ensuring that every
            product—from an e-commerce clone to a custom API—is built on a
            foundation of professional, industry-standard practices.

            on LinkedIn and GitHub, where I regularly share my latest work and
            code updates. I am happy to hop on a call or exchange messages to
            discuss how my technical skills can help solve your specific
            problems. I make it a priority to respond to all inquiries as
            quickly as possible to keep the momentum of our conversation going.
            When you send a message, feel free to include details about your
            project so I can provide the most helpful feedback from the start.
            Even if you don't have a specific project in mind, I’m always open
            to networking and connecting with other developers and tech
            enthusiasts.
